# Siemens_Analysis
This repo contains the analysis for the Beer mash extraction efficiency regression task

**Author**: Ankith R Menon


## Steps to run:

1. Please run the AnkithMenon_Beer_dataset_EDA notebook first.
2. Next, please run the AnkithMenon_Beer_dataset_ModelEvaluation notebook.


The AnkithMenon_Beer_dataset_EDA will generate npy files that will be stored in the same location as the two notebooks. These npy arrays are the training and testing arrays after the EDA and preprocessing is complete.


## Installed packages
For this analysis, these are the packages used and their version information:
python                    3.8.5
scikit-learn              0.23.2
scipy                     1.5.2
seaborn                   0.11.0
xgboost                   1.5.0
matplotlib                3.3.3
mlxtend                   0.19.0
numpy                     1.19.2
pandas                    1.1.3


## Presentation
I have attached a file link_to_presentation.txt which has the Google Drive link of AnkithMenon_presentation.mp4. The mp4 file contains the demonstration of my entire analysis for the given problem.

## Attached files list
- AnkithMenon_Beer_dataset_EDA.ipynb
- AnkithMenon_Beer_dataset_ModelEvaluation.ipynb
- new_beer_train.csv
- link_to_presentation.txt
- X_train.npy
- X_test.npy
- y_train.npy
- y_test.npy

The npy files are not really needed as they will be generated by the AnkithMenon_Beer_dataset_EDA.ipynb notebook; however I have included them for reference.
